            Wordify makes it easy to identify words that discriminate categories in textual data.

            Let's explain Wordify with an example. Imagine you are thinking about having a glass
            of wine :wine_glass: with your friends :man-man-girl-girl: and you have to buy a bottle.
            You know you like `bold`, `woody` wine but are unsure which one to choose.
            You wonder whether there are some words that describe each type of wine.
            Since you are a researcher :female-scientist: :male-scientist:, you decide to approach
            the problem scientifically :microscope:. That's where Wordify comes to the rescue!

            Create an Excel or CSV file with two columns for each row:

            - a column with the name or the label identifying a specific object or class (e.g., in our
            wine example above it would be the type of wine or the name of a specific brand). It is
            common practice naming this column `label`

            - a column with the text describing that specific object or class (e.g., in the wine example
            above it could be the description that you find on the rear of the bottle label). It is
            common practice naming this column `text`

            To have reliable results, we suggest providing at least 2000 labelled texts. If you provide
            less we will still wordify your file, but the results should then be taken with a grain of
            salt.

            Consider that we also support multi-language texts, therefore you'll be able to
            automatically discriminate between international wines, even if your preferred Italian
            producer does not provide you with a description written in English!
